It's been long since the Crawley project isn't updated, we're proposing some ideas for the future milestone:

##Proposed Features

- Refactor most of the code to remove duplicated code
- Have chardect to detect the encoding of the page content and not trusting the header encoding only.
- Remove elixir dependency and use the declarative SQLAlchemy feature.


##When is this changes going to be ready?

Probably from here to about a couple of months at most.
